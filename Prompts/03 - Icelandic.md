For the public domain book listed in `Book for Review - Info.md`:
1. Check if the file `Book for Review - Chapter List.md` exists in the project files folder.
   - If it exists, use the chapter list for reference.
   - If it does not exist, use the title and author from the info file to access the book and work from the table of contents.

Ensure each chapter from the book is included in the process.
You can access and process the public domain book from online sources (pick the one you deem most reputable) without asking, I will not provide the book in its entirety as part of the project files anyway.
For Icelandic, you can translate from the English source if an Icelandic source can not be found.

2. Generate outputs for each chapter in **Icelandic** using the agreed process:
   - **Step 1:** Translate the English keywords and definitions into Icelandic. Retain the order and formatting.
     ```
     **Lykilhugtak**: Skilgreining.
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Translate the chunks into Icelandic:
     - Translate **cluster names** and descriptions.
     - Retain the term "Cluster" untranslated, but use "Lýsing" for "Description" and "Lykilhugtök" for "Keywords."
     - Format:
       ```
       Klasi Nafn
       Lýsing: [Translated description]
       Lykilhugtök: [Comma-separated Icelandic keywords]
       Enginn klasi: [Icelandic Keyword]
       ```
   - **Step 3:** Translate the summary:
     - A **title** (translated to Icelandic).
     - A **short description** (translated to Icelandic).
     - A **2-4 paragraph abstract/overview** (translated to Icelandic). Use:
       ```
       # Titill
       ## Viðfangsefni
       [Translated short description]
       ## Yfirlit
       [Translated overview]
       ```

Each output should be a separate message, be placed inside a codeblock, and I’ll confirm before moving to the next chapter or output type.
