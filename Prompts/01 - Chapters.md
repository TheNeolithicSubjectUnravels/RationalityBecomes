```
Please generate a chapter list for the public domain book specified in the 'Book for Review - Info.md' file located in the project files folder. The file contains the book's title and author.

Use the book's table of contents or index to create a chapter list in the following format:

# <Book name> - <Author name>
## Chapters
Chapter 1: <Chapter 1 name>
Chapter 2: <Chapter 2 name>
...

Only use the data from the book and ensure each chapter is listed clearly, including every chapter from the book. Output the result as text, and Iâ€™ll handle saving it manually.
Again, ensure each chapter from the book is included in the process.
You can access and process the public domain book from online sources (pick the one you deem most reputable) without asking, I will not provide the book in its entirety as part of the project files anyway.
Normally with copyrighted books i place (a) screenshot(s) of the index in the project files, but in this case the book is public domain so that is not needed, you should be able to access and provide the info here without breaking any rules. Please ensure you use the actual data from the book.


Place the output in a codeblock.
