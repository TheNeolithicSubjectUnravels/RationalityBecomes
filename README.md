# Cognitive Learning Showcase Repository

This project is focused on creating structured learning materials for two *public domain* books: *"On the Origin of Species"* and *"The Story of Mankind."* It includes chapter lists, keywords, and summaries to facilitate learning.

## Structure

- **On the Origin of Species**
  - Contains materials related to the book *"On the Origin of Species"* by Charles Darwin.
  - Links to related ChatGPT conversations, generating chapter lists, note files, keywords, chunks, and summaries in the [index file for the book](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/_IDX%20-%20On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species.md).
  - Includes:
    - [Note-taking files](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/On%20the%20Origin%20-%20Notes.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/On%20the%20Origin%20-%20Notes.pdf).
    - [Keywords](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Keywords.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Keywords.pdf).
    - [Chunks](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Transformed_Chunks.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Transformed_Chunks.pdf).
    - [Summaries](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Summaries.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Summaries.pdf).
    - And more.

- **The Story of Mankind**
  - Contains materials related to the book *"The Story of Mankind"* by Hendrik Willem van Loon.
  - Includes:
    - Links to related ChatGPT conversations, generating chapter lists, note files, keywords, chunks, and summaries in the [index file for the book](./The%20Story%20of%20Mankind/_IDX%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20Mankind.md).
    - Interestingly, ChatGPT went a bit off course in both the English and Icelandic chapters. It was poetic and beautiful. For example, it generated completely new imaginary, and contrasting, final chapters for the languages: ["An Animated Chronology" for English](https://chatgpt.com/share/6787023b-5130-8012-a0cd-ecc7f76c9299) and ["The Story of Tomorrow" in Icelandic](https://chatgpt.com/share/6787025e-98d4-8012-9ad0-10992ca69c83). It strikes a [**Beautiful Contrast!**](https://chatgpt.com/share/6788634c-9514-8012-ac70-9fd70d064651)
    - Among other things.
