# Cognitive Learning Showcase Repository

This project is focused on creating structured learning materials for two *public domain* books: *"On the Origin of Species"* and *"The Story of Mankind."* It includes chapter lists, keywords, and summaries to facilitate learning.

## Structure

- **On the Origin of Species**
  - Contains materials related to the book *"On the Origin of Species"* by Charles Darwin.
  - Links to related ChatGPT conversations, generating chapter lists, note files, keywords, chunks, and summaries in the [index file for the book](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/_IDX%20-%20On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species.md).
  - Includes:
    - [Note-taking files](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/On%20the%20Origin%20-%20Notes.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/On%20the%20Origin%20-%20Notes.pdf).
    - [Keywords](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Keywords.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Keywords.pdf).
    - [Chunks](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Transformed_Chunks.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Transformed_Chunks.pdf).
    - [Summaries](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Summaries.md), also available [in PDF](./On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species/The%20Origin%20-%20Summaries.pdf).
    - And more.

- **The Story of Mankind**
  - Contains materials related to the book *"The Story of Mankind"* by Hendrik Willem van Loon.
  - Includes:
    - Links to related ChatGPT conversations, generating chapter lists, note files, keywords, chunks, and summaries in the [index file for the book](./The%20Story%20of%20Mankind/_IDX%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20Mankind.md).
    - Interestingly, ChatGPT went a bit off course in both the English and Icelandic chapters. It was poetic and beautiful. For example, it generated completely new imaginary, and contrasting, final chapters for the languages: ["An Animated Chronology" for English](https://chatgpt.com/share/6787023b-5130-8012-a0cd-ecc7f76c9299) and ["The Story of Tomorrow" in Icelandic](https://chatgpt.com/share/6787025e-98d4-8012-9ad0-10992ca69c83). It strikes a [**Beautiful Contrast!**](https://chatgpt.com/share/6788634c-9514-8012-ac70-9fd70d064651)
    - Among other things.

- **Prompts**
  - Includes the questions used to generate information, such as note taking files, chapter titles in Icelandic and English, key points, and summaries.

## Basic Usage

- Use prompts from the [prompts folder](./Prompts) for generating the note-taking files, the keyword, chunk and summary files for the book.
- (Optional) Use any MarkDown to pdf converter for documents to be printed.
- Review chapter lists and keywords to understand the main topics.
- Use the summaries to get a brief overview of each chapter.
- Use the note taking files to capture brief notes when doing initial review of each chapter.

## Potential Learning Workflow

1. **Memorize Chapter Names**  
   Use a rote serial memorization technique to learn the chapter names in order through reinforcement:  
   - **Print the notes file**: This file includes a few empty lines for each chapter.  
   - **Initial thoughts**: Fill in the notes file with your initial thoughts on each chapter's subject. (These donâ€™t need to be 100% accurate yet.) This step creates an associated memory for each chapter. As you try to recall the chapters in order, youâ€™ll have context to link them to, resulting in a series of "AHA ðŸ’¡!" moments for each chapter name you recall. Suggestions on how to do this can be found in step two.

2. **Explore the Chapter Content**
   - **Option A**:  
     - Read the summary file for each chapter.  
     - Condense the summary into your own words and jot it down on the notes file.  

   - **Option B**:  
     - Insert all the information for the book into a new ChatGPT project.  
     - Open a text/voice chat within the project and ask ChatGPT to review the chapters with you.  
     - Request brief summaries, clarifications, or questions about each chapter. (Again, this does not need to be 100% accurate at this stage.)  

3. **Dive Deeper into Each Chapter**
   - Once you start remembering the chapter names, apply the same process for individual chapters:  
     - Use the chunks file and keywords file for context and details.  
     - Move from rote memorization of chapter names to memorizing the chunks and associating them with the keywords.  

4. **Master the Keywords and Context**
   - Memorize keyword definitions.  
   - Give the chapter a full read-through for a deeper understanding.  
   - Consider live tutoring for further clarification or interactive learning.
